# burger

### The goal of this assignment was to create an app following the MVC design pattern while using Node, MySQL, and Handlebars.

#### Eat That Burger

    The app itself is designed to "create a burger" by typing in a type of burger.
    Once you hit enter that burger is added to your burger list and you have the option to "devour" the burger.
    Devoured burgers then go on the "devoured list"


#### Development

    I followed the guidelines from the HW 13 ReadMe file to organize all of the folders and files.
    Once I had all of those in place I used the CatsApp from Folder 13 Activity 17 to help write the code for the Eat That Burger App
    Even though all the files and connections were correct I was unabel to get the app properly functional but I was able to deploy it to heroku.
    I beleive the problem is with the burger.js file in the Public/Assets/js folder.
    
Future Development

    In the future I would like to make the app functional so when you type in the burger name it appears in the "here's your burger" card and then when you "devour it" it goes to the "Eat The Burger" card
